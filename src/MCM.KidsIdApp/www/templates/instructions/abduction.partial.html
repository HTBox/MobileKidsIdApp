  <p>If an estranged parent or former spouse has abducted your child, call the police immediately.</p>
  <p>If you live in Minnesota, tell them you believe that he or she has violated MN State Statute 609.26 (all 50 states have laws making it a felony to take a child with the purpose of depriving a parent of their parental rights).</p>
  <p>Under Minnesota law, it is a crime for a parent to take a child even if they have sole of joint custody or if custody has not been determined. This is a complicated law and many police officers are not familiar with it. If you have trouble filing a police report, contact Missing Children Minnesota right away. If you have reason to believe that the parent or family member that took the child may take them out of the United States, please refer to the International Child Abduction section of this ap as well.</p>
  <p>If you are outside the state of Minnesota, call AMECO <a href="tel:+18772632620">(877) 263-2620</a> for the AMECO affiliated organization nearest you.</p>
  <p>If parents were not married when the child was conceived or born, or if parents have never been married, custody is automatically with the mother under Minnesota law. The father does not have custody unless there is a custody order or agreement on file with the court. MN Statute details are here: https://www.revisor.mn.gov/statutes/?id=257.541</p>
  <p>It is a criminal offense for a parent or other family member to take or keep the child from their lawful parent with the intent to deprive that parent of his or her parental rights. If your child is taken, retained, or concealed from you, (especially in violation of a court order or on-file custody agreement) call and report this to the police then contact the National Center for Missing and Exploited Children at 1-800-THE-LOST (1-800-843-5678), as well as AMECO at (877) 263-2620 for the AMECO affiliated organization nearest you.  MN Statute details are here: https://www.revisor.mn.gov/statutes/?id=609.26</p>
  <p>Under 42 U.S. Code SS 5772 A “Missing Child” is defined as an individual less than 18 years of age whose whereabouts are unknown to such individual’s legal custodian.</p>
  <p>Under the National Child Search Assistance Act of 1990, NO law enforcement agency can establish a waiting period to take a missing child report. The name and identifying information of the child must be entered into the National Crime Information Center (NCIC) Missing Person’s file immediately upon taking a report.</p>

    <h4>Parental Abduction Prevention Tips</h4>
    <ol>
      <li>Get professional legal help to create a detailed custody order or agreement that specifies who has custody, what the child’s residential arrangements will be, what the conditions of visitation are, what the conditions are for either parent to remove the child from the state, and which specifically prohibits a parent removing the child from the state for the purposes of establishing residence for the child in another state without the permission of the other parent.</li>
      <li>Abide by the custody order or agreement yourself, and document any significant violations of the order or agreement by the other party. If you have concerns about allowing the child to go with the other parent for their court-ordered parenting time, be sure to involve someone who can document the conditions under which you are refusing to allow the parenting time.</li>
      <li>Be alert for any sudden and dramatic changes in the other parent’s life (loss of job, selling the home, breaking a lease, closing bank accounts, etc.)</li>
      <li>Take any abduction threats seriously, and inform the courts as well as the police. Contact your attorney for advice.</li>
      <li>If you believe that the other parent has taken the child and intends to deprive you of your parental rights, do not delay. Call the police, and ask that they make a report as well as entering your child and their description into the FBI’s National Crime Information Center (NCIC) right away. There does not need to be a criminal warrant to enter your child as missing.</li>
      <li>If the other parent is a citizen of another country, your child may have dual nationality. Contact the embassy of that country and inquire about their passport requirements for minors.</li>
