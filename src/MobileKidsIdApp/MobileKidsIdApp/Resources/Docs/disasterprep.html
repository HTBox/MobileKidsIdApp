        <h1>Disaster Prep</h1>
        <p>Here are some resources to help you and your family know what to do should your family become separated in a disaster.</p>
        <p>The CDC has an excellent and detailed resource on how to prepare your family in the event of a disaster.</p>
        <a href='http://emergency.cdc.gov/preparedness/index.asp'>CDC Disaster Preparedness</a>
        <p>A contact card is a really good way to start. These cards can be placed in wallets, backpacks, inside phone cases (between the phone and the case). It’s a great way to make sure that your family members all have the info they need to reunite with you in a disaster</p>

        <p>In particular, think about these things:</p>
        <ol>
            <li>Does your city, school system and employer have a disaster preparedness guide?</li>
            <li>Do you know what will happen if you need to be evacuated? </li>
            <li>If your children need to be evacuated from school?</li>
            <li>Have you signed up for your city’s Reverse 911 and Code Red systems, so that you will be notified in the case of an emergency?</li>
            <li>If you are signed up, is your information current? Consider checking to be sure.</li>
        </ol>
        <p>Quickly familiarizing yourself with this information will go a long way toward reunifying with your family after a mass disaster.</p>
