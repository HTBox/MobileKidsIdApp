The MCM.KidsIdApp project uses typescript which gets compiled to javascript.  Some IDEs will automatically compile typescript on save in-place; in-place meaning it will take /scripts/controllers/myController.ts and create /scripts/controllers/myController.js.  This option should not be used because there is Gulp task called 'scripts' which converts typescript to javascript and concatenates it into a file called appBundle.js.  This allows us to only need to reference a single script instead of needing to maintain a long list of scripts.
